# Finessflix

For my Specializations (Web Development) 23 Capstone Project, I made a full stack React application titled **_Finessflix_**, a web application that allows users to store all of their streaming accounts all in one place. The inspiration for my project stemmed from a random thought I had one day: with the direction that big streaming services are moving towards, such as increased pricing and advertisements, account sharing had become more prominent than it ever was. But honestly, who can remember all those cumbersome passwords? I know I can’t. Worry no more, thanks to Finessflix!

### Login Page
![Login](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thaitommytran/specializations-capstone-project/main/client/src/screenshots/finessflix-ss-login.png)

Upon arrival to my website, you’ll be presented with this login screen. If you don’t already have a user login, you can create one by clicking the sign-up button. Upon successful login, you'll be redirected to the main view.

At the top, the header will display the app name, a nice little greeting, and a logout button.

Users will also find a form where they can add new accounts to be stored down below. The total count of stored accounts will be displayed next to *Your Accounts*.

### Main View

To narrow your search critera, simply use the provided input field in the top right corner. Users can filter their search results by *website* or *username*.

Passwords for your stored accounts are hidden by default. To toggle them on or off, simply check or uncheck the show passwords box to reveal or hide your passwords, respectively.

Lastly if you have an account that you no longer need, you can click the trash icon provided in the account card to remove it. 

Once users are done managing all their streaming accounts, they can click the logout button, which will redirect them back to the login page.

###### Groups
In the future, I would like to implement a way to incorporate groups for users to join. With groups, users will be able to select which of their stored accounts they want to share with other members of the same group.

###### Responsiveness
In the future, I would like to make this web application responsive so that it can be viewed properly on both PC and mobile.
